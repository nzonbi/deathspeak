# okami

compact and expressive programming language on top of javascript, for increased productivity


okami syntax is designed with these goals:

* compact: avoid syntax noise.
* expressive: agile syntax of expressions.
* easy to read: compact and noise free syntax that is easier to read.
* easy to write: agile and compact syntax that is easier to write.
* simple: based on clear and coherent concepts.
* comfortable: smaller conceptual footprint for reduced programmer stress.

 
okami is not the right way, is just an option.
