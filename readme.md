# deathspeak

stylized, compact and expressive programming language on top of  
javascript, that does not follow common syntax preconcemptions,  
for increased productivity.


## prealpha

This project is in prealpha status. Everything is under work
and may change.

## note

The okami language employs standard language features,  
but the syntax does not follow common convetions from other  
languages, so it may not seems easy to read at first.  
An special ide is planned, that will allow to learn the  
language on the fly, at near zero cost.

## about

Symbols characters have great expressive power, that can  
succinctly convey ideas. okami is based on the _subjetive_  
perception, that programming languages have left untapped  
potential, in the expressive power of symbols.

okami is an attemp to maximize representation of precise and  
clear concepts, with the expressive power of symbols. It is  
also part of a research project in software design, with  
goals that will be presented in the future.

okami is built on top of javascript, because Javascript is  
rapidly becoming an impressive language, in terms of spread and  
recently even in performance. And in its quirks, has many hidden  
gems of expressive power. But suffers from historical baggage  
and of having to please everyone.

## goals

### main goals:

* language based on simple, and precise concepts.
* compiles to readable javascript.
* work easily side by side with javascript.
* syntax designed to maximize succintness and expressive power,
  bypassing any preconceptions.

### syntax goals

okami syntax bypass any preconceptions, so it may not be
easy at first. it is designed with these goals:

* compact: avoid syntax noise, repetition and thrash.
* expressive: agile syntax of expressions.
* easy to read: compact and noise free syntax that is easier to read.
* easy to write: agile and compact syntax that is easier to write.
* simple: based on simple, precise and coherent concepts.
* comfortable: smaller conceptual footprint for reduced programmer stress.

## license

open source license to be added soon

## Introduction

For now there is no introduction. Only the specs working  
draft

* More to be added
