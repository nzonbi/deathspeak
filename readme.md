# okami

stylized, compact and expressive programming language on top of  
javascript, based on clear and precise concepts, for increased  
productivity.



## about

Symbols characters have great expressive power, that can  
succinctly convey ideas.

okami is based on the _subjetive_ perception, that programming  
languages have left untapped potential, in the expressive power  
of symbols.

okami is an attemp to maximize representation of precise and clear  
concepts, with the expressive power of symbols.

It is also part of a research project in software design, with  
goals that will be presented in the future.

okami is built on top of javascript, because Javascript is  
rapidly becoming an impressive language, in terms of spread and  
recently even in performance. And in its quirks, has many hidden  
gems of expressive power. But suffers from historical baggage  
and of having to please everyone.

## goals

### main goals:

* language based on clear and precise concepts
* syntax designed to maximize succintness and expressive power

### syntax goals

okami syntax is designed with these goals:

* compact: avoid syntax noise.
* expressive: agile syntax of expressions.
* easy to read: compact and noise free syntax that is easier to read.
* easy to write: agile and compact syntax that is easier to write.
* simple: based on precise and coherent concepts.
* comfortable: smaller conceptual footprint for reduced programmer stress.
